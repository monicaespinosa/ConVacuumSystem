# ConVacuumSystem
This is a project done at EST-RUB. Here is the control and interface of a vacuum system using a Pfeiffer turbo pump plus a backing pump

## Current circuit
The circuit (still to try) goes as following:

The voltage of the grid (1 kV) must be increased from 0 V slowly to see the reaction of the environment to the voltage according to the pressure. The voltage of the Wehnelt cylinder is completely experimental.

## Current measurement
The current measurement stated in the last picture should be something like this:

The current flowing through R_mess is theorically expected to be in the microampere (ÂµA) to milliampere (mA) range. Supposing that the current is 10mA, the following circuit was simulated to choose the value of R_mess:

The voltage across Rm increases as Rm does. A value of Rm=140 ohm is temporarily chosen.




Proposals of instrumentation amplifiers are:

### 1. TMCS1100 (By Texas Instruments)
The TMCS1100 is a galvanically isolated Hall-effect current sensor capable of DC or AC current measuremen. The output voltage is proportional to the input current with four sensitivity options, which are shown in the next table:

However the smalles current that this sensor is able to measure is 125 mA (for the TMCS1100A4). This also measures up to 12 A, which should be enough. Ordering number: TMCS1100A4QDR.
