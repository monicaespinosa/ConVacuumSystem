# ConVacuumSystem
This is a project done at EST-RUB. Here is the control and interface of a vacuum system using a Pfeiffer turbo pump plus a backing pump

## Current circuit
The circuit (still to try) goes as following:

The setup still has to be simulated to find out V_c and to check the accuracy of the voltages selected for the grid and the plate.

## CST Simulations of the setup
The following setup was simulated:

Initially were the following voltages set:
* V_S 6.4 V
* V_C: 6.4 V
* V_G= 400 V
* V_P= 1000 V

The result for the obtained trajectory is shown below. The obtained current was around 5 mA.

However, the shape of the electron beams seems to change its shape in a very drastic way. Making the V_C smaller (more negative) should help concentring more the electrons to the center of the beam. A second simulation was made sweeping the voltage of the Wehnelt_Cylinider between -10 V and 6 V. 

Charges on the plate:

Particles that come out of the coil:

They are only high when the voltage at the Wehnelt Cylinider is equal or higher than that of the coil. A new simulation sweeping Vc between 6.4V and 15.4V is been made. Results:


## Current measurement
The current measurement stated in the last picture should be something like this:

The current flowing through R_mess is theorically expected to be in the microampere (ÂµA) to milliampere (mA) range. Supposing that the current is 10mA, the following circuit was simulated to choose the value of R_mess:

The voltage across Rm increases as Rm does. A value of Rm=140 ohm is temporarily chosen.




Proposals of instrumentation amplifiers are:

### 1. TMCS1100 (By Texas Instruments)
The TMCS1100 is a galvanically isolated Hall-effect current sensor capable of DC or AC current measuremen. The output voltage is proportional to the input current with four sensitivity options, which are shown in the next table:

<img width="537" alt="image" src="https://github.com/monicaespinosa/ConVacuumSystem/assets/42346349/e9c50c54-f587-4aef-983e-6dd9759625b7">

However the smalles current that this sensor is able to measure is 125 mA (for the TMCS1100A4). This also measures up to 12 A, which should be enough. Ordering number: TMCS1100A4QDR.
