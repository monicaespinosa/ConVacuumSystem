At this moment, the Arduino Code has 4 functions: 
1) Communicate with the TC110 usisng the RS485 protocol and register all relevant data about the turbopump. 
2) Read the external pressure sensor. 
3) Display the relevant data of the system in a external LCD
4) receive an user input to modify the settings of the pump

functions 3 and 4 are needed for the system to be fully independant from a computer.
